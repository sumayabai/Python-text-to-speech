The objective of this project is to convert the text into voice with the click of a button. This project will be developed using Tkinter, gTTs, and playsound library
To implement this project, I will use the basic concepts of Python, Tkinter, gTTS, and playsound libraries.
Tkinter is a standard GUI Python library that is one of the fastest and easiest ways to build GUI applications using Tkinter.
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python library, which is a very easy library that converts the text into audio.
The playsound module is used to play audio files.
